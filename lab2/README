towersMain is the main program file of the towers of Hanoi, 
towers contains a recursive algorithm to solve the towers given as arguments in the terminal.
to use the program use the command 

towers <n> <from> <dest>

where n is the number of disks, from is starting location, and dest is the end location

There are some conditions to the input the program will accept.
it will not accept numbers higher than 3 in the arguments <from> or <dest> (only 3 tower ID's 1,2,3)
it will not accept matching numbers for arguments <from> or <dest> (example towers 3 2 2)
it will not accept negative numbers 
it will not accept a value of 0 in any location
it will not accept string as a valid input
it will not accept only 2 arguments, it will however accept 0, 1 or 3 arguments

running the command with no arguments will proceed to sort 3 disks moving them from tower 1 to tower 2
running the command with only 1 argument will proceed to sort the disks given in the 1st argument from tower 1 to tower 2

files junk1 junk2 and pureStdout are files that contain the output from testing the stdout and stderr speration as per mention in lab manual.

last tested 01/27/2020 and everything was in working order.

Questions:
1. if you call towers (5,2,3) it will recursively call towers (4,2,1)

2. there will be 5 recursive calls to towers until it returns to its initial invcocation

3. the move that towers (5,2,3) will make is moving the first disk from tower 2 to tower 3

4. the second recursive call to towers () will be towers (0,3,2)

5. if towers (8,1,2) was invoked, there will be 255 lines of output.
