Summarize your lab:

  Part 1:
     Works  Yes
     
  Part 2:
     Works  Yes but doesnt list the output counter
     
  Part 3:
     Works  No

note: an attempt was made to get part 3 working but was unable to get it functioning. part 2 will test validitiy
correctly but does not print out the counter for which letter for an unknown reason. 
to run each part you must use the data file and change the inputs there since for some reason the terminal does not
work. to read from the file a command such like "validateXML <data" or "countXML <data".

       It is identified with a '/' (slash) preceding the
       final >.  (For example, the <foo/>
