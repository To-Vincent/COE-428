State machine fully works with intended state machine given, a state diagram is included with this lab along with a screenshot of the state machine assigned
Change state is functioning
print states is functioning
delete state will delete the state but currently cannot check if state is deleted and you will be able to go to a deleted state still
an attempt at garbage collection was made but it does not work, it was commented out of the code in order for the lab to run
a quit function was added in order to exit the program without having to terminate the terminal.

last tested on 3/3/2020 base commands (0, 1, q, p, c) were fully functioning, command d was half working and command g failed to run.
